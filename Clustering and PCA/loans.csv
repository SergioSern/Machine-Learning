Ahmed Baba has been selling through Novica since 2008. This is his story:

""After completing my elementary education, I became a self-taught woodcarver. My creations are both decorative and utilitarian. My materials come from our environment, and I use various types of wood and plate to form different designs. I feel proud to have shown my art in Germany, the United States, South Africa, and Namibia.""

""Without your support, I do not know how I could have survived in this business. I thank you so much.""

1266423,50000,1519,funded,2017-04-18T06:42:43Z,50000,12,BJ,Agriculture,"<a href=""http://agpowerbenin.com/""> Tolaro Global </a> is a cashew nut processing business based in Parakou, a small town in Northern Benin. Founded in 2010, Tolaro sources raw cashew nuts directly from local farmers and transforms them into processed cashew kernels for export. It is the first factory in Africa to receive the African Cashew Alliance quality seal (an industry-accepted mark that confirms compliance with international standards of quality, food safety and social and labor standards). Today, Tolaro employs more than 400 Beninese men and women with formal salary jobs and sources its cashews from over 7,000 smallholder farmers in the region, for whom the business also provides technical training to increase cashew yields and incomes.

After more than six years of operations and thanks to a solid client base, Tolaro now has the opportunity to grow by transforming larger quantities of raw cashew nuts, which is conducive to more employment, as cashew processing remains a largely manual process. However, in order to achieve this target, Tolaro needs more working capital financing ahead of the season and to purchase cashews during the harvest period.",to add value and jobs to the local economy by starting a new factory to roast and pack cashew nuts.
1480779,50000,1574,funded,2018-04-06T22:46:13Z,50000,14,BJ,Agriculture,"In February 2017, MCE made a 12-month loan of $400,000 to Tolaro, supported by $50,000 raised through Kiva. This loan was successfully repaid in full to MCE and Kiva lenders. MCE's first loan to Tolaro was highly catalytic as it enabled Tolaro to grow its business, expand its operations, and become a more bankable borrower. In 2018, as Tolaro's financing need increases, MCE is looking at providing two new loans for a total of US$600K. One of these loans will have a 12-month duration, while the other will be longer-term (3 years) in order to equip Tolaro with more structural and permanent funding. This Kiva loan will support the first of these two loans, a short-term working capital loan that will allow Tolaro to invest in new equipment, expand its production capacity, provide more salaried employment opportunities, and source more cashew nuts from local farmers in the region. 

Tolaro's impact is evident across several dimensions: 1) by providing expanded market access to local farmers, 2) by creating local, salaried employment in a rural area with few other formal job opportunities, 3) by contributing to several additional outcomes such as improved food security and childhood education, and 4) by generating added value for the Beninese economy.",to promote the growth of the business by transforming larger quantities of raw cashew nuts sourced from local farmers.

Gottlieb works for Elephant Energy. Elephant Energy is a Namibian Trust that employs a market-based approach to spreading access to affordable energy technologies in rural areas throughout Namibia. These are technologies that improve the quality of life for people living without electricity, who are forced to rely upon costly, inefficient, and health-hazardous energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and single-use batteries.  Because of the barriers imposed by Namibia’s vast distances and limited transportation network, Elephant Energy’s strategy focuses on a highly decentralized network of village-based energy entrepreneurs who bring both education and products to their communities.

Gottlieb lives in Oshakati, Namibia with his wife and children. He has been an actor in rural development over the past 16 years and is driven by his passion for delivering renewable energy solutions to Namibia’s rural areas. Amazingly, he has worked in rural areas in all 107 constituencies in Namibia, which has brought him a keen understanding of the realities faced by the many thousands of Namibians who live off the electric grid. Gottlieb understands both the social and technical sides of solar energy, is skilled in installing, maintaining and repairing solar home systems, and has a keen awareness of what drives and motivates the adoption of new energy practices by rural families. 

This loan will be used to purchase the inventory needed to expand Elephant Energy’s rural entrepreneur model to six new regions of Namibia that are home to the majority of Namibia’s unelectrified population. This is part of Elephant Energy’s strategy to provide improved energy alternatives to 10,000 homes (or 50,000 individuals) in the year 2013.

Barefoot Power is a valued partner because they provide products that are in high demand by Namibia’s off-grid populations. The products are sturdy and rugged enough to withstand Namibia’s harsh desert environments, affordable enough for even the poorest customers to afford, and their focus on integrating cell-phone charging functions provides a huge value-add to these products at a time when the number of rural Namibians with cell phones is rising at a rapid rate.
